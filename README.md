# Workflow

When making decisions on this project, the following keywords should be in mind ordered by importance:

1. Self-sustainability: This project should be able to generate economic revenue. Prioritizing features is key.
2. Productivity: Using previously acquired skills is preferred. Learning new stuff is not discouraged but not rewarded either.
3. Open: It should be easy for anyone to jump in and contribute.

Any form of revenue should be split depending on the amount of contribution to the values described above. This should be calculated using peer reviewing.
